Standalone Information & Installation
We have designed NPWD to be generally framework agnostic, meaning that it can easily be
integrated with both popular open source frameworks like ESX & QBCore or any arbitary
custom framework.

For further details on this system, please refer to our installation documentation 7.6k.

Technical Stack and Development
NPWD uses React + TypeScript to form the NUI front end and uses TypeScript (V8 runtime) for game
scripts. You can find more technical information regarding the development of this project on our docs
page here.

Feature Request & Issue Reporting
Please open an issue/enhancement on our Github Repo 5.5k. This is the best way for us to track what needs to be resolved or improved upon.
